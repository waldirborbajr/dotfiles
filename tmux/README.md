#+TITLE: Tmux Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Tony, btw

* Installation

This is my tmux config. It's a zero-plugin setup with vim-like keybindings and a Tokyo Night Moon theme.

To use this config, first make sure tmux is installed:

#+begin_src sh
# Arch
sudo pacman -S tmux

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tmux

# macOS
brew install tmux
#+end_src

Then point tmux to this config by symlinking it:

#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/tmux
ln -sf /path/to/this/tmux.conf ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf
#+end_src

Or if you just want to test it out without symlinking:

#+begin_src sh
tmux source-file /path/to/this/tmux.conf
#+end_src

* Configuration Breakdown

** Terminal and Display Settings

#+begin_src conf
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
set -ga terminal-overrides ",*:RGB"
#+end_src

These lines enable 256-color support and true color (RGB) support. The first line tells tmux to advertise itself as a 256-color terminal, and the second enables 24-bit RGB colors. This is essential for proper color rendering in tools like Neovim.

#+begin_src conf
set -g mouse on
set -g set-clipboard on
#+end_src

Mouse support lets you click between panes and drag borders to resize. Clipboard integration means when you copy text in tmux, it goes to your system clipboard.

** Prefix Key

#+begin_src conf
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix
#+end_src

This changes the prefix from =Ctrl-b= to =Ctrl-a= because it's way easier to reach. The third line lets you send the actual =Ctrl-a= to the terminal if needed.

** Pane Navigation

#+begin_src conf
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R
#+end_src

Vim-style pane navigation. After hitting the prefix, you can use =h/j/k/l= to move between panes.

#+begin_src conf
bind -n M-h select-pane -L
bind -n M-j select-pane -D
bind -n M-k select-pane -U
bind -n M-l select-pane -R
#+end_src

The =-n= flag means "bind without prefix". So =Alt+h/j/k/l= lets you switch panes instantly without hitting prefix first.

** Splits

#+begin_src conf
unbind %
bind | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

unbind '"'
bind - split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
#+end_src

Split windows with =prefix + |= for vertical and =prefix + -= for horizontal. The =-c "#{pane_current_path}"= part makes new panes open in the same directory as your current pane.

** Config Reload

#+begin_src conf
unbind r
bind r source-file $HOME/.config/tmux/tmux.conf
#+end_src

Reload your config with =prefix + r= without having to restart tmux.

** Window Management

#+begin_src conf
set -g base-index 1
set -g pane-base-index 1
set-window-option -g pane-base-index 1
set-option -g renumber-windows on
#+end_src

Start numbering windows and panes at 1 instead of 0. This is more ergonomic because window 1 is on the left of your keyboard. The =renumber-windows= option automatically renumbers windows when you close one, so you don't get gaps.

#+begin_src conf
bind -n M-1 select-window -t 1
bind -n M-2 select-window -t 2
# ... (continues through M-9)
#+end_src

Jump directly to windows with =Alt+1= through =Alt+9=, no prefix needed.

** Copy Mode

#+begin_src conf
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi v send-keys -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi C-v send-keys -X rectangle-toggle
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
unbind -T copy-mode-vi MouseDragEnd1Pane
#+end_src

Vim-style copy mode. Enter copy mode with =prefix + [=, navigate with =h/j/k/l=, press =v= to start selection, =y= to yank (copy). The =C-v= binding lets you do rectangle selection like in vim. The last line prevents mouse selection from exiting copy mode automatically.

** Theme

The rest of the config is the Tokyo Night Moon theme. The color variables are defined at the top:

#+begin_src conf
thm_bg="#222436"
thm_fg="#c8d3f5"
thm_cyan="#86e1fc"
# ... etc
#+end_src

The status bar shows:
- Current window with a checkmark and the last two parts of the current directory path
- Other windows showing just their index and name
- Right side shows window name, a visual indicator that changes color when prefix is pressed, and session name

The status bar format strings look complex but they're just using tmux's format variables like =#I= (window index), =#W= (window name), =#S= (session name), and conditional formatting with =#{?client_prefix,...}=.

* Keybindings Summary

| Bind               | Action                      |
|--------------------+-----------------------------|
| =Ctrl-a=           | Prefix key                  |
| =prefix + \vert=   | Split vertical              |
| =prefix + -=       | Split horizontal            |
| =prefix + h/j/k/l= | Navigate panes              |
| =Alt + h/j/k/l=    | Navigate panes (no prefix)  |
| =Alt + 1-9=        | Jump to window (no prefix)  |
| =prefix + r=       | Reload config               |
| =prefix + [=       | Enter copy mode             |
| =v= (copy mode)    | Start selection             |
| =y= (copy mode)    | Yank (copy) selection       |

* Notes

This config is heavily inspired by Henry Misc's zero-plugin approach. No TPM, no plugins, just native tmux features.

If you want to change the theme colors, just swap out the =thm_*= variables at the top with your preferred color scheme.
